#    LSTM Hardware Acceleration using Synthesizable Floating Point RTL

> Offloading LSTM matrix-vector multiplications (Wx·x and Wh·h) to custom-built, synthesizable IEEE-754 compliant SystemVerilog modules.

##   Project Overview

This project identifies and offloads the most computationally intensive part of an LSTM model — the **matrix-vector multiplications** — into **synthesizable SystemVerilog RTL** modules.

The core idea is to:
- Profile the LSTM using `cProfile` and `snakeviz`
- Extract bottlenecks (Wx·x, Wh·h)
- Re-implement them as IEEE-754 compliant `fp_add` and `fp_mult` blocks
- Combine them in a pipelined, FSM-controlled `matrix_vector_mul_fp` module
- Simulate and compare performance with NumPy-based model

##     Why This Project?

LSTM models, especially when deployed on edge devices or FPGAs, face computational bottlenecks in matrix operations. This project demonstrates:
- Custom RTL design without external IPs
- Realistic co-design for ML acceleration
- Full integration between Python profiling + RTL execution
